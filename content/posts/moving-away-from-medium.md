Hi everyone,

This post is a small introduction on why I decided to move away from Medium and publish this blog.

This blog is born because of Medium reading limitations.

The main goal of my posts is to share my experiences and opinions on software development when something interesting pops up along my projects (and I'm not too lazy to write about it). Other reasons that would push me to write something is sharing clarification and examples of how to use some tools, especially when there's a lack of clarity on the original documentation.

Now that I've set the scope of my blog, it's not hard to understand how sharing is the central part of it and I don't want any obstacle for people to read it.
From now on, I won't publish blogs post on Medium anymore.
Here's my Medium account to read my old ones https://medium.com/@magini.giacomo.

Cheers and happy development!

Giacomo
